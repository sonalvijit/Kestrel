# Kestrel Programming Language

This is my **`C project`** for creating a programming language similar to Python, but with a different twist. The purpose of this project is to learn more about the **`C`** programming language, its core concepts, and more.
<br><br>
**`Kestrel`** is a project I’m building primarily to learn **`C`**. It’s a hands-on approach to understanding the intricacies of **`C programming`**, from memory management to syntax design. While it's in its beginning phases, I’m focusing on building a solid foundation that will eventually allow me to explore more advanced concepts in C Programming and Language design.
